## contributing

Should you wish to contribute, you're in the right place.

Building the sigstore the hard way requires [mdBook].

[mdBook]: https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/mdBook

cargo install mdbook
```

Once installed you can use the `mdbook` command to view in realtime the sigstore-the-hardway documentation.

```bash
mdbook serve --open
```

You do not need to build before making a pull request, we have a CI action that will automatically
build the site and push it to the live site.

To run the tests:

### Translations

We'd love help translating the sigstore-the-hardway! See the [Translations] label to join in
efforts. Open a new issue to start working on a new language! We're waiting on [mdbook support] for multiple languages
before we merge any in, but feel free to start!
